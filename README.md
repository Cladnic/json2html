# json2html

### :small_red_triangle: Status : Work in progress :running:

## Background

I wanna be able to throw some json-files into a directory and automatically generate html tables for them, but I couldn't really find anything like that on the internet, so I'll just make it myself.

## How to use
(1) Clone or download repo

(2) Open repo path in terminal and run:
```text 
npm i
```
```text
npm build run  
```

(3) Check so that the generated .html file is the way you want it
